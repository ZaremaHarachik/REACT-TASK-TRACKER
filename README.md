# REACT TASK TRACKER

Demo: https://zaremaharachik.github.io/REACT-TASK-TRACKER/

A simple task management app built with React. You can add, delete, and set reminders for tasks. The app uses React hooks and routing to create an interactive experience. Currently, tasks do not persist after page refresh because the app does not yet save data to localStorage or a backend API. I plan to add this in future updates. Through this project, I learned React component structure, state management, hooks, event handling, routing with React Router, and debugging issues related to state and persistence. To run locally, clone the repository, install dependencies with npm install, and start the server with npm start.
